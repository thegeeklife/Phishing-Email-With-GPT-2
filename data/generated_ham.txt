BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany said on wednesday it would take legal action against four executives of a state oil company for allegedly trying to defraud a trust run by a NUMBER million man who died in a crash in alb in the east of the country a spokesman for the chief executive said that the company had offered to pay the families of the victims at least NUMBER million euros for the release of their dead grandson but the deal fell through and his company was not awarded any compensation the executives were eventually released and the public is not so lucky britain said all outstanding awards would be paid to the families when they reach NUMBER million euro in cash or other reward money must be returned within NUMBER months of their passing if the officials are released the money should be forfeited to reimburse the victims taxes and fees costs are likely to rise sharply as the economy rebounds far better than expected economic growth in the european bloc s biggest economy slowed this year and growth in the rest of the world is slowing already the european authorities have promised more investment and more jobs but the real estate boom that destroyed the alb last year has died down in europe and the europeans are not buying it chancellor Angela Merkel is looking increasingly likely to use the euro after five years of european attempts to turn a corner in western europe where crime and poverty are high unemployment is almost twice as high as in the rest of the european union and many alb residents are dissatisfied with the state of their midst the europeans have promised better education and much higher taxes to pay for them chancellor end of a political spectrum that includes chancellor stefan schaeffer a right of passage especialy to the right of prime minister frankfurter hat what is clear is that the europeans do not want a society in which the rich and powerful enjoy an extra level of social protection from taxes they do not want a society in which everyone can own a home and thrive on social protection the fundamental case for a change this is the kind of social liberalism that engenders the great majority of europeans believe in it thirty years ago the fundamental argument against a new social liberalism was the exploitation of the working class it was an appeal to the social decadence of the state a kind of meritocracy in which the wealthy were allowed to own everything they wanted and where property rights were not as central to the people as in the west but there were limits on absolute power and property rights did not engender popular popular opinion in europe the european ruling class stuck to its guns and accepted the views of its academic allies in the west the west ignored the problems in their own countries and worked to create them the problems of the bloc they did not want to solve them in europe they did not want to create them in the west they did not want to expand their sphere of influence the problems of terrorism and cold war espionage were also not domestic for the europeans they did not want to help them build their empires within them the problems of global terrorism and of the rogue states were domestic for them they did not want to fight them europe also has a history of supporting terrorist organizations and they did not want to go against their own interests europeans do not normally have this problem of being oppressed or threatened when a political regime or terrorist movement oppresses or threatens us we are not prepared to accept it we have worked very hard to make it clear that this is a very serious problem when the us and others come together to oppose fascism in NUMBER we asked ourselves if it was worth fighting the war on terrorism we would have done it sooner we would have won it because we had faith in the goodness of the people and the goodness of the institutions we defeated an insidious conspiracy by the powers that be to keep the world from coming to its senses the united states has not been helpful to this conspiracy we will work with others we will learn to live in a way of life america will help others to live in a way of life the united states has also served as a bulwark against other great powers the united states has not been a single great power just like the united states was during the war of words it is not enough to merely be a bulwark for others the united states has also served as a bulwark against insidious totalitarian ideologies ideology is a tool of oppression and it is a tool of freedom america is not a happy place when a religion symbolizes violence we must not allow it thrive in an environment of oppression and suffering hate speech and intolerance we must encourage people to live in a world that appreciates human dignity and respect our history as a secular nation has often been marked by tolerance and sometimes hostility we are better equipped to deal with differences when we are challenged by history and values we must build bridges of tolerance and understanding where differences of opinion are ugly they are also dangerous they can cause suffering the first time a person challenges a taboo or a practice is arrested for example many in the west have not been charged with hate speech because they have not held hate speech signs or published photographs which they consider offensive they do not have

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will offer asylum to a fugitive asylum seeker who was held at sea for six months on charges of making war crimes during an interview to the weekly newspaper on condition of not being interviewed by wire services in the port city of Heiden on condition of not being interviewed by a broadcaster on condition of not being interviewed by alex grayson flannister garriguedutsche newspaper on the migrant held by the albanian war criminal briano machete links arms and defected to the pakistani militant group pakistan on the run in suspected war crimes during the interview the fugitive is wanted by the united police service and other agencies for allegedly trying to attack the klingon radar base at ruhr on sunday and is wanted by the state security service and the border police on suspicion of terrorism luiz felipe cerny the daily newspaper mentioned machete as an example of someone who tarnished the reputation of the united states on the world stage such as the dethronement of haud james vilegg the fugitive may have inspired the attacks on the french and the uk archbishops there is no word on whether machete was behind the attacks in japan or in the us or whether other countries are listening to his calls and are ready to help him out he told the paper the transfer of information was not easy i m sure he meant that by us and by our friends and we are not the only ones who have done this he added with a hint of humanity i think it s important that the united states and other countries work together to free this man because he has done no wrong he said referring to the weapons transfer he had said that the united states would give him full freedom we have no problem with that we need someone who can walk on the tule factory floor with impunity the question now is whether we will be willing to give him our full cooperation in the field of counter terrorism i don t know if the united states is ready for this or not but we are trying to help him out he said with the exception of a few isolated cases the united states had offered machete to anyone seen using arms and ready to fight anyone who challenged the status quo the problem

BERLIN -- Federal prosecutors on Friday announced that they had arrested more than a dozen people in connection with a double whammy of british defections that hammered europe s fragile economic recovery the first major case of such defections since the end of the second world war it was the latest blow to hardliners trying to shore up their chances of a third world thaw after the collapse of the war in afghanistan that hardliners have tried to paint them as soft on terrorism since the arrest of a british man who worked with a man suspected of working with al Qaeda the case is likely to produce evidence that will aid their cause high court critics of the war in britain have accused the government of a de facto policy of appeasing hardliners and appeasing tyrants since the arrest of a british man who worked with a man suspected of working with al Qaeda the case is expected to produce evidence that will further enrage hardliners who regard the government as weak and corrupt in their war against global terrorism some of those arrested yesterday included a british man known only as the marshall for security reasons he was carrying a passport with a charge of contravening an airport airport policy when he was arrested the passport bore the inscription al NUMBER NUMBER which translates as the treasure of the fathers from the late dictator cain but it was seized by police on suspicion of being printed with the intention of facilitating terrorism the marshall said al NUMBER men were arrested on charges ranging from trying to import forged passport numbers into the united states and distributing forged passport pictures to aid terrorism the war against terrorists and other charges against the men included aiding and abetting terrorism and are prohibited from doing so the united states has already arrested NUMBER NUMBER individuals for cooperating with foreign terrorist organizations the united states has also announced it will launch an investigation into the allegations against the men and will make further arrests in the next few days the united states will hold a press conference to brief the public on the arrests shortly after the conference and ask the press secretary for lewis libby to visit the site of the arrests to learn more about these arrests the united states already has more arrests under way than any agency of government in the united states police command and the british security services have responded to the crisis by expanding their presence in some of the most remote places on earth america s leading democracies people are increasingly questioning the legitimacy of western intelligence assessments that back up the us government s assertions that the british response is weak and warning signs are mounting america will have to contend with a diverse array of evidence that could shape up before we decide whether or not the case is credible the us response to the al NUMBER NUMBER statement has been mostly negative the united states has repeatedly claimed that it is wholeheartedly following the case and has promised to conduct an independent investigation into whether the statements are credible the arrangement of materials and other support has not helped that assertion police and security services are also discovering new technologies and methods in the field making it possible to conduct covert operations without government approval intelligence services are also discovering the value of open societies and of working with other people in open societies such as open societies intelligence services have a particular focus on underground markets in electronic goods for the most part electronic goods are not likely to be exploited by terrorists or other organised crime lords but are a good means of getting involved a government employee who has been compromised by a serious vulnerability can be the first to respond to a potential attack the united states is committed to a common approach to counter terrorism i have known a lot of american intelligence service professionals who were exposed as supporting the war in iraq because we felt it was important to help the government of jordan because we thought it was important to help the common cause and to help the united states in other ways too many in america believe this to be the case the united states has a tradition of cooperation with other countries particularly the european union and the united states drew up a number of agreements with key euro countries in the NUMBERs to help fight the terrorists including the soviet union and the defense cooperation and defense cooperation act of NUMBER this act provided for the creation of a joint task force on counter terrorism this task force headed by congressman george tenent has initiated a new congressional investigation into the attacks and the administration has promised reforms but reforms have not been forthcoming senior government officials have been characterised as morons and as having a radical agenda by a senior intelligence official visiting american countries has become a regular practice senior officials from the other major intelligence agencies have left their posts hoping for better relations with key countries but instead the infighting and corruption that characterises the inner workings of these centres of global intelligence has worsened an intelligence problem that between each other the value of information is often in the thousands of dollars a day carried by a few close to one country the ability to carry out covert operations in foreign countries without government approval without the threat of assassination the scale of the problem is growing exponentially now that the senior officials we spoke with are gone

BERLIN and france are set to open talks next week to discuss a possible summit of the iraqi foreign minister said on condition of not disclosing the progress of the talks in any specific detail talks in britain are always a good place for specific proposals but this one at britain s request would be an important one see article bricolage france next week in choice of two print issue or online issue with a special section on france and iraq i have been told by many sources that the two sides are in talks about a possible summit of the iraqi foreign minister says that talks on iraq are usually closed to foreign diplomats but talks in britain usually takes place weeks in advance as the two sides work on their bilateral relations there are several issues that need to be settled such as the rights of senior iraqi officials to return to their countries of origin but disagreements remain over basic requirements for membership iraq has so far refused to grant citizenship to any non Persian citizen who doesn t agree to the terms of the riyadh accords which is why many say a riyadh visit would be inappropriate because of the animosity toward iraq one foreign ministry official told euronews that while giving interviews in iraq it would be difficult to deny that the talks could be a catalyst for positive change in iraq some argue that the growth of the united states of America into a pillar of regionalism is over and that the path of integration of european countries including france has been blocked by europe s status as a nuclear superpower there is no question that the united states of america and europe constitute a dominant power in the world at large there is no question that the european project is a powerful tool for isolating the riaa and riav the key to ending the hegemony of the iraqi royal family is the emergence of a new french royal family and the establishment of close economic and political relations with iraq a process underway at the national level that could produce a french patrilineal government a patrilineal one that would be accountable to the president jean jean boubacour s re lire the riaa s executive would be a powerful tool for persuading iraq to reverse its commitments to abide by international norms on the rights of the sick and prevent its stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction the current riav patrilineal government has not yet proved to be able to fill all the positions vacated by the former prime minister jean boubacour and would be sworn in at a later date no one believes that the riaa will be able to hold any more sway in the world than the royal family which ruled iraq for more than a generation before the rise of the riav patrilineal party has begun to assert itself in an attempt to rewrite the law of international politics replacing it with a patrilineal modern form the riav patrilineal party has also taken up the threat of force to its neighbors if they do not stop interfering in their internal affairs and start growing their own food and agriculture and starting to do their bit to promote their national interest this is a very real possibility but there are too many vested interests with too much sway in the world parliament passes too little law and has too little power to act in a manner that favors their own personal agendas the financiers of the terrorists are planning a war on all america and all their servants so they are using this moment of national resurgence to take all the wealth from the americans and use it for their own nefarious ends the united states government

BERLIN has announced that it will phase in its practice of granting asylum to people found wanting or unwilling the move comes after decades of freeze on asylum seeker numbers sparking protests and sparking government intervention in recent weeks chancellor Angela Merkel has promised a more open and tolerant society although the scale of the problem is staggering officials admit that half of those admitted this year are wanted fugitives or reschons who should be returned to their countries of origin berlin said in a statement the move was a historic first step towards integration and a step towards integration no party has dominated the political discourse since the communist party founded in germany in the hope of becoming the center of international opinion after the war ancillary

of belonging is legal albeit a complicated one some citizens are eligible for refugee status while others are refused entry and sent home before being accepted at any time the reality of the matter is that some are not so lucky most are not even aware they re not equal and they cannot be counted on to get by them again berlin is now trying to normalise that by opening its doors to people who are

BERLIN (Reuters) - State sponsor tax payer ejido will start accepting checks from uk residents next week although the bank says it expects the tax relief to help the affluent the scheme has already attracted record amounts of attention from other nations including the ireland and iceland with reports from a tax consultant in asia george powers russia china and australia all citing ejido as a beneficiary the bank s tax haven status could prove controversial in europe where the ejido tax haven was created in the NUMBERs by conservative governments but which some say is growing increasingly acceptable as tax avoidance becomes more sophisticated ejido is run by an anonymous donor but even though donors can donate money to charities in europe they are not required to register as charities after all that are tax exempt and therefore not allowed to give money in trust to the unblessed would be easy prey for the donor said one donor in this case a ejido foundation worker who asked not to be named because the sensitivity of the issue is confidential the ejido foundation source said donors who give money to other european outfits such as the eurogroup must register with the tax authority and arrange for it to be spent on public housing and other improvements in europe an anonymous donor group can ask for this kind of money i think this is crucial because it gives the impression that they are part of the deal and that this is something that europeans should be taking part in the european effort to fix this problem european governments initially rejected the idea of such a scheme but later developed it into a source of economic growth even before the bloc joined the euro europe project which aims to free the economies of the other european nations european states have long complained that their economies are not being unfairly stretched under the gagging tax laws on the basis of their national wealth rather than the principle of supply and demand the problem with the ejido scheme is one of over supply and under the gagging tax laws the europeans got the idea from rich countries such as the european sumos for instance which raised about NUMBER NUMBER million during the election campaign in NUMBER but was bogged down in the fact that the german government only came to power after the fall of the soviet empire in cse american empire in the meantime the european state raised about NUMBER million during the european empire in NUMBER and NUMBER but only about NUMBER of them made it into office and the rest went to the socialists who won the next NUMBER elections because they were rich and because the german investment industry was well positioned to exploit the weak economy in the east and exploit the weak european economy in the west the problem is that the rich don t get to choose what happens in their lifetimes and the socialists are in a position to make the best of a bad situation because of this the scheme could be the first step towards tax credits for the ejido benefactors who raised more than NUMBER NUMBER million during the election campaign in NUMBER and who now make up about NUMBER percent of the federal election spending according to michael cum laight of the libertarian forum i think the biggest problem we have right now is a perception problem because we are trying to figure out who is really the real celebrity donor and who is not sikhim and the problem with that is we are making a mess of our own society and our reputation so people are wondering who the real celebrity donor is because of all the speeches he or she makes michael cum laight said it is a difficult question because is it a question of social morality or is it a question of economics that says you should give money to people who need it or should hedonies that hedonies that you don t and that you would rather not pay because they are not worth anything and that is the crux of the question because it is a very personal question for me personally i am a forty five year old man who was living in fear financially and i am thinking about whether i should give money to people who need it or not because they are not worthy and i don t want to give it to someone who is not worthy and that is the crux of it you have to understand that you re in a very hard situation if you don t help people who are not worthy of your love you are hurting them and they resent you and they are just a convenient damian ballad

forces have effective law enforcement capabilities to disrupt and destroy organized crime and support local anti crime efforts coordinate closely with other law enforcement and security institutions and local law enforcement and security institutions to prevent the movement of international terrorists to the united states and to other countries where they are planning terrorist acts mitigate the effects of the operations against our people by identifying and preventing the movement of terrorists where necessary closing the borders effectively reduce the number of terrorists in the country and provide more security to americans through the use of military force we will also continue to work to build consensus among the great powers on the right balance to prevent another world war i resolve the issue of national security the recent war in afghanistan has been a difficult one for those of us who are friends or who are allies of the united states to be allies of the united states of many nations we know this history even before the war was begun in our democratic history the war against terror was conducted in a spirit of deism no matter the cost to our nation or our way of life we will always defend the cause of freedom fight for it as those who fight for it defend it with all our might as we wage a war against terror we will also strive to free the world from its acute affinities the great powers are great and important allies of freedom and of course we are also friends and partners in a struggle against terror we must help build governments that are strong and free and ignite productive nations that are prosperous and growing able to help finance democratic struggles against global capitalism and the worst types of oppression against women and minorities we will fight terror to preserve the peace and to crush the worst forms of global capitalism justice must be served through the application of market principles to all aspects of life while we recognize that world war i was fought to defend the world against world war ii is over a nation is a person is a system lives in a world of interconnectedness market democracies are institutions just as important as people in addressing social and economic problems all over the world they can play a crucial role in shaping social and economic systems through which individuals and communities can make progress against their will we are also people insofar as societies themselves are persons of a spirit of discovery and inquiry not as persons talk and live in a world of information but as persons speak and think they can understand why societies exist and how they are doing so and how they are doing it is only by understanding and embodying those changes that we can promote flourishing societies at all costs through democracy and through open societies in countries afflicted by epidemics of tuberculosis and cholera tuberculosis that we can build up a world of safety and well being for people in need and for profit so that they may be able to meet their daily lives freely distributing food and clean water is the first step towards sustainable development and the first step towards freedom society is guided by this vision of freedom every citizen has a role in shaping his own future and a role in society as a whole has to be educated and engaged about the implications of developments for his society he who does not conforms will be destroyed he who does not conforms will be destroyed he who doesn t conforms will be destroyed he who doesn t conforms will be destroyed

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will block all bank and euro bank loans to countries hit by climate change next week while offering financial help to those who are affected said the federal election campaign on condition of anonymity the move came just days after the weather service released a forecast of a global cooling world temperature expected to top NUMBER this year s record low in a report which called global warming a hoax perpetrated by human activity the european economic council called global warming a hoax perpetrated by western industrial nations and made up of drillers from the world s biggest oil companies all oppose the move a spokesman said european companies had already agreed to lend money to countries if they so wished it was voluntary talks on the issue will resume on september NUMBER with a view to blocking any remaining bank and euro bank loans in the coming days the most powerful voice of protest is coming from the upstart anti walrus tribe which has so far refused to support the move a spokesman said walrus leaders believed that by continuing to work in the global trading blocs was now giving rise to the energy security industry which could use the cash it has been holding in euros the walrus most vulnerable to global warming but campaigners welcomed the move saying it was a first step towards reducing suffering and reducing global poverty campaigners welcomed the decision as proof that central and western civilization are moving towards a model of conservation of environment that cuts only through the ugly facade of science however campaigners continued to press for action against the tribes and other vulnerable groups walrus are still denied equal access to the sea floor and equal protection under the law many argue that these rights should not be trampled on further evidence that campaigners are increasingly making the case for the death penalty for non profit islamic groups have also gained ground in recent weeks when campaigners for the environment and human rights won court battles in berlin and palun latongi s appeal against the hanging of disgraced environmental lawyer nunca paul was heard to be suffering from undue stress the latest setback in a long line of victories for environmentalists last month the international fund for nature targeted paul for death for its efforts by saying that paul should die in the nearest legal means human suffering would be acceptable in the end the international fund for nature view paul as a criminal figure whose crimes deserve no death sentence and whose case will be heard by a committee led by the justice minister esi o rossi who has since recanted his past statements once described paul as a criminal who should die in prison but whose sentence should be commended even if the jury fails to reach an innocent verdict environmentalists have long argued that paul deservedly received the death penalty for his contributions to the environmental movement and that the abolition of the death penalty would usher in the inevitable decline of his cause this is a grievous mistake they have not argued for an execution but for the hanging of an innocent man to hell with the logic of history the ultimate consequences of which will be horrendous human suffering on both humans and other animals further evidence of this increasingly extreme rightist position on nature continued after the first successful attempt was made on the life sentence by a western court in japan this was the first time that a western court had ever tried a death sentence which is itself neither legal nor moral nor even rightist in the core will defend the death sentence on appeal to overturn the conviction but that was hardly the end of the difficulty in achieving the desired result the government in doing all this without the aid of private companies or semi semi zen zen centres is not only incredibly stupid but also downright corrupt and corrupt when you don t use the legal system to promote the interests of the big multinational corporations who dominate global markets like all other forms of monopoly they also have a huge debt load to pay back their investors and

BERLIN and the united states are committed to a comprehensive strategy to defeat terrorist groups that support the terrorists of either of the left or the right of center parties has included air power and ground forces as well as modern communications advanced electronic warfare and threats are taking shape including iraq i and china i and others ambitious plans however the relative weakness of these states demonstrates the difficulty of convincing these groups to transform and modernize and to be effective counterproliferation efforts air power alone does not prevent rogue states from acquiring the weapons needed for proliferation i e the threat of such capabilities and the political will to do so if deterred rather than thwarted remain a key element of the war against terrorism efforts especially in the western hemisphere where rogue states are particularly potent and the international community is less able to block their development efforts in the region where diplomacy is weak and the regional financial system is shaky it is important to emphasize that these efforts are not the first steps in the right direction regional response will require coordination with the states domestic and foreign policy and will require elements of both international and domestic military might so that u s and our allies can have a voice in shaping the direction of the regional effort efforts so that u s and our allies can be confident that they will be able to play a constructive role in regional transitions such as the one in afghanistan and qatar we will need contributions from both countries as well as international organizations especially the united nations and states canals and coast guard fleets as well as small arms and marine scientists to support transition planning and defense and law enforcement to ensure the success of the transition the united states is committed to regional cooperation in all areas from law enforcement to education and health care as a permanent part of the american security strategy we will continue to work with regional countries to address security challenges such as ballistic missile development to prevent the resupply of weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations and other means of coercion the united states will also continue to work to improve the coordination of interests among the regional powers and to improve the level of mutual respect that exists between these efforts the united states has long maintained a nonproliferation position maintaining a nonproliferation regime is important to the interests of both countries and to the security of the nonproliferation regime but maintaining it is also essential to preventing the rogue states that threaten our allies and friends from becoming the dominant nuclear power the reality is that only after world war iii can we strike back against the terrorists or wade in his managed chaos as we have in the past did so after the attack on the world trade center in fact wade is in control of his inner circle and knows how to behave but it takes a skillful leader to sideline him and to make him look like a newcomer in the administration s thinking the problem with wade s behavior is that he is inexperienced in the international arena the habeas case is no different china s policy in this area is rather weak and monger than us has proven more effective than our own in recent years a good example of this is the connabilty of courting rich countries for bribes in jamaica in fact the practice is even more pathetic than we are used to in the us where corruption is rampant and where the wealthy and educated manage to curry favor with the cranks they also extort money from governments and businesses in other words they thrive on coercion and fear rather than on the cooperation of other countries and the selling of goods in exchange for money the habeas case is no different than selling gas in chechnya in contrast the real estate industry in africa is not so self depraved as some western governments pretentious propagandists reaped the rewards of the slave trade and cheap labor in the us in short then we are all morally culpable for fueling the flames of fascism in the us and helping to promote it in the forbes NUMBER british empire in short then we are all too proud to admit that we are in fact better than your slave owners and doing our bit to end the suffering of fellow humans on the global scale the united states has proposed a new and more subtle form of u s assistance the first step in the process of actually siding with the rebels is a full and frank transition congress would then have the power to reject the terrorists and to impose the same horrible policies on those who oppose them the united states has proposed a different approach this is not to say that the united states would not use force in a different way for example in the past we have used force against iraq we used against iran we have used against iran s people and we will use force in the future to achieve our goals the united states has a statutory duty to intervene when it deems appropriate under international law we have the same statutory framework as all other nations and we expect our allies we will defend your peace you will not begrudge join this effort or send your own forces to help defuse a potential war in afghanistan or fight the jihadis in Iraq or fight the taliban in the south or fight the Taliban in the north these are legitimate uses but they do not fully compensate

BERLIN (Reuters) - German chancellor Angela Merkel said on february that the european union should play a crucial role in solving the russians problems but said such a goal should not overwhelm her in her first public comments on the subject on september the anniversary of september the anniversary of september the slaughter in maurice drew sharp criticism of her government for failing to play the crucial role of stabilizing the russian economy this has not bodes well for a fragile european economy the chancellor said on february NUMBER in romania a truck driver whose truck was cut off in two by ram ramen was killed in maurice when his badly burned body was found by a member of the emergency management team only days before the atrocity there was widespread anger at the state of emergency and dissatisfaction with living conditions in the east which had worsened following the collapse of the soviet union in the east that year there were NUMBER million euros ($ NUMBER million million million million) of cuts at the state broadcaster oss and hundreds of thousands of euros in cuts elsewhere at the national broadcaster and also at albrecht which was broadcast on nyc in the west which year workers at a plant for iron ore workers lost their jobs amid protests and corruption charges daniel thuringth a spokesman for the state broadcaster said all cuts had been taken out of the economy and not as a consequence of human suffering but as a result of a growing sense of security in the russian labor movement that has grown in number since august last year the move highlighted the challenge facing state broadcaster nyc and the government as it works to remedy the problems highlighted on february NUMBER by the interior minister of zurich the biggest steel producer whose case has been invited to the federal cabinet for further consideration prompted by widespread dissatisfaction with living conditions in the east said the crisis may have worsened those conditions worsened in mauretze as well and today it is not only the russian public that is suffering said kurt glick an economic development analyst at the conservative think tank center for strategic studies whose research focuses on the european crisis i e particularly the collapse of the steel industry in august and early august of NUMBER showing that industrial output per capita has not grown rapidly enough to support such a claim the economist omile osservatore joseph schumpeter of the social sciences department at the conservative think tank peter flohr has written about the difficulties of rebuilding the russian economy in europe he urged the russian government to focus on building economic productivity growth even if it meant rebuilding the russian labor market michael bloomstone of the conservative thinktanks institute for strategic studies which also happens to be a close ally of chancellor steflõfel avrich von schumpeter said the current situation in europe is like throwing a football match between the red hot supporters of marc s champions the rossd and the trailing champions the usc slovakia s vosto vosto vosto vosto obscuro will always be a joy to watch watching the vosto obscuro team take control of the half court of a stadium nicknamed the crazy one because of the crazy way they play they play off a line and score a basket but it s not the way they do it michael he says 








they also cut back on the use of the word british in connection with the publication of an article citing the appeas book on the british people i d assume that the article cited is what the article on steve money was referring to i have been hearing about steve money for some time now and i don t think it is in the article the appeas book but certainly in the article was mentioned the lack of innovation by levine and others as well as the absence of innovation in the manufacturing sector which is something that the united states should be promoting and which the united states should be helping to implement one more way to make america more competitive at the office unlike most other countries in the world where innovation is a top priority for itself the american continent is not without its innovative industries though innovation is encouraged encouraged not destroyed though this is a crucial difference in practice among european countries innovation is encouraged not destroyed though that is an artifact of a system in which innovation is encouraged more often than not the evidence is overwhelming that if you are going to promote competition innovation is encouraged rather than discouraged a point that i would make particularly in the west where innovation is encouraged and opportunity is discouraged many of the same arguments can be made for creating more free markets in the name of progress in the rest of the world i have no doubt that creating new productivity opportunities is a fundamental part of what makes up the russian success story though the scope of this particular area of expertise is growing it seems best to focus on the effects of industrial civilization on personal development and not on the long term health of the country it is important to understand just how important this is not only as

military presence essential for democracy and international order afghanistan africa are key theaters for terrorism where violent extremism prevails governments squander basic human rights and ignite

BERLIN and other european nations have asked the federal trade agency to investigate allegations that european companies are dumping fuel embargoes by packing more oxygen in the tanks to keep them warm but the efforts have so far been fruitless the complaint said the european complaint was the product of years of poor management european companies were supposed to be selling less coal and to have been largely spared from the effects of the euro collapse when it happened the trade agency seems to have succeeded in putting all that veneer off the inquiry the issue is under investigation the potential outcome of which is uncertain because the investigations are ongoing european officials have maintained that they do not expect their european allies to use economically unstable states to rebalance their economies the same criticism they have applied to the government in belgrade the crisis may have been averted by now the european union flag flies at half mast mast in belgrade on saturday the national flag flies at half mast mast at half mast in belgrade the soldiers from the european mission to india are sitting in the back of the plane the plane was en route from chicago to chicago they were not in chicago for the meeting of the europar association the officials said the european governments were not in chicago for the meeting but that the representatives were encouraged by the fact that officials there were briefed on the situation in india the officials said the european response to the crisis was very much the same as what it was during the cold war consultations in france european leaders are no longer convinced that the political will exists to overturn existing law and to create a new european government the officials said the european response to the crisis is not a new one the european goal is to resolve the outstanding issues involved in india the officials said in essence it was a brand new effort the european response is based on a very old concept that all european democracies are democracies because the people in india represent the people of europe the european project is based on a different ontology that rejects the notion of a single entity and instead believes in a continuum of development the european response is based on a third worldview that favors open societies integrated markets and pluralism pluralism is the new normal for the united states the european response reflects a belief in the future not an outdated one the officials said the united states should emphasize the need for integration particularly in agriculture and in manufacturing not in hypergrowth but in every sector of the economy the response also reflects a fundamental change in thinking among the european institutions the officials said especially the commission president a former military general who favors open societies but has a past record of supporting authoritarian tendencies in the south and in the northeast the commission sees india as a model for other countries particularly in the western Balkans where open societies and integration are key ideas the commission hopes to implement a variety of policy proposals in its first year the commission plans to focus its attention on three areas the most important being a shift from military intervention to a more integrated relationship with the european project the commission will look at ways to expand the european program such as by appointing a top expert on south american integration the commission hopes to implement this in its first year the period of rapid economic growth experienced by india should be a good time for the european development agency to develop a roadmap for attaining a trade surplus with the euro that would enable india to achieve its strategic priorities the european development agency was created in NUMBER by a constitutional amendment passed in NUMBER recognizing the independence of india the agency has since been transformed into a global agency charged with carrying out activities beyond the capabilities of the country concerned the main tasks of the agency are the protection of india s sovereignty and the enforcement of laws against interference with national economic interests the main areas of its competence the european development agency will be based at the american embassy in chicago the agency will have an active office in new york city wallace ph d wallace irvine ca will chair the american development agency lower es us sep NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER america needs a strong link between development assistance and human development projects in other countries the american example shows just how much can be done to promote a balance of power that respects human dignity the american example also shows just how little is done to deny the sickening reality that some developors have special interests which also hold global sway the agendas of key global institutions are repeatedly aligned against european interests for example in europe the american development agency which has a distinct political and financial agenda is opposed to athos the european development agency which has the same political agenda is opposed to the united states development assistance must be integrated with other multilateral development agencies multilateral development banks and other development institutions must be more actively engaged with the private sector to ensure that their influence is not used to further political agendas in any case it is important to remember that the united states has a much bigger stake in shaping how aid

BERLIN, Sept NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am berlin allen höhn wrote a paper on the european migrant crisis the implications of which are not known are quite as read the paper was published in june as the report from a panel of european economic development experts concluded that the current situation in europe is neither sustainable nor straightforward read the european migrant crisis in particular illustrates the difficulties in integrating new populations particularly in the south europe and south america european countries account for less than half of all new migrant arrivals in the western europe and only about a third of all new permanent residents are from north america the paper pointed out that this large emerging market has welcomed large numbers of skilled workers especially in manufacturing and tourism which has provided a breeding ground for recent waves of new european immigrants the paper pointed out that the report contained important lessons for europe for reasons that remain unclear the panel of experts included a professor at avantard connolly s university in florida and a professor at the florida institute of international studies which studies the sociology of science and industry a collaboration between avant connolly s university and florida research group on international politics the institute projects that the european migrant population between NUMBER and NUMBER million will be here by NUMBER and the rest will be coming from other countries in the future this group of people might include people from south america ca or south america and australia the institute projects that this population will increase by between NUMBER and NUMBER million over the next NUMBER years and that it will increase by africa being one of the countries affected by it the report said that the united states must make every effort to help those who are denied basic human needs like water sanitation and nutrition deportation to poverty beg beg beg beg deportation the united states has stepped up assistance given to asylum seekers in europe an observation by arrondissement par excellence institute director general norman cross cultural minister joel rossen said european asylum seekers and their families are often moved to new or different locations to be reunited with their families but this must not be viewed as a burden on the country s taxpayers europe is an attractive locale for asylum seekers because of its close proximity to u s borders and the fact that it has a strong economy europe has long been a haven for asylum seekers from war torn regions of the european south and the industrial heart of southern europe the recent surge in interest from european asylum seekers is part of a broader trend that the european

BERLIN and other european countries on the other hand have lost at least two major wars and suffered more than a few casualties in some cases the suffering is enormous in a continent that has experienced a great deal of the development of modern military capabilities only recently did major events necessitate such enormous emotions that we are compelled to react in a manner that is both provocative and provocative enough that we cannot reasonably be expected to care about them moreover even if we do somehow agree on some particulars of particular crises we know very little of the advanced capabilities of the dominant powers in the union and of the other main centers of global power in europe the europeans have suffered three world wars and six world wars more than any other nation in the world and yet we still regard them with increasing international concern we feel that we cannot allow the europeans to become too much like the terrorists or the drug lords or even the major terrorist organizations of today the current war in afghanistan is not a war against the taliban or the far right or even the far left of the far right of any of the major terrorist

BERLIN -- Germany is to spend more than twice as much on mental health as it does on other essential health needs of its citizens even as welfare benefits rise for some workers the initiative comes after years of massive investment in mental health systems in the western world such as the euro area and north america that have proven the country s success berlin has long championed the concept of universal basic income a concept that has drawn fierce opposition from european progressives including élites et français espéen a quarter of afrikaans speaking for the working class of europe it is not just the rich who are in the running for being fatter but also many other countries with which berlin has a common language the concept has been proposed as a means to help unemployed people with special needs get the help they need the new initiative from the federal department for social affairs will focus on this type of problem in the east now also the aim is to raise the profile of berlin as a progressive liberal democracy a good example of this is the national insurance foundation which won berlin the right to run its own programme providing it can show that it can promote social and economic justice chancellor frank de Maiziadamudi has promised to introduce a national budget programme in the next month or so and will have a budget for social programs in the first quarter of the

assistance are growing in faith that this kind of assistance can help them grow score some developed countries are starting to do that i don t know how they are doing it is just remarkable the amount of money that they are being given out on the whole it is unusual for a developed country to be giving anything back its policies have been improving in many important respects but not quite sufficient for most people what the global financial crisis had brought was a dramatic transformation in the political culture of some europeans some were saying this was like having a narcotic in your bath the problem with narcotics is that you never know what you will get yourself if you are not careful you may never know what you will get score some development assistance is a far more powerful indicator of a country s potential than intelligence the european intelligence service scored it as a very serious danger in their report from the intelligence service in this case the score indicates that you are not your country you are not what you think you are going to get the intelligence service scored it as a very serious danger in their report the score indicates that you are not what you think you are going to get the european intelligence service scored it as a very serious danger in their score the score indicates that you are not what you think you are going to get a lot of people are starting to understand that intelligence is not just a label one who doesn t understand it the real danger is people who don t know what they are doing score some money in europe a country which does not have a history of funding terrorism europe is also home to some of the worst drug abuse in the world according to a report from the american research council american bureaus of australia found that the illegal drugs trade in europe is quadrupled the international ransom paid for the life of the Colombian president heather upjohn said the european states have a moral obligation to help those in need and do so despite the chaos and poverty caused by war and intimidation europe has a proud tradition of cooperation in infectious diseases prevention and treatment while other western countries have tended to be more cooperative these traditions have not so much encouraged the transfer of lethal technologies as encouraged hostility scores of former communist communist fighters are planning attacks against european states intelligence agencies and key institutions in europe this hostility against european states has worsened as well says the american research council american bureaus of australia the most lethal country on earth is at the borders it s called the transatlantic pact against terror the transatlantic pact makes no distinction between european states and the so called green card countries who are citizens of the single market and citizenship rights problems in the european north could complicate efforts by european states to forge

seem to have buckled when the world war ii staff were told that the world war ii staff would be transferred to u s dc for storage there would be to a month each year for the storage of the staff of the staff of the dc the reason given was that the us military might not be able to maintain the site and all those american artifacts which might be in the desecration of after the collapse of the soviet empire by the way you mention iron gates the site of the world s first free trade center bombing survivor and one of the worst destroyed buildings in u s history as well as a damaged wrought iron gate that might hold the key to the secrets of the world s great iron workings also of great interest is the archaeological site of the losing world champions of marxitic civilization which has another historical element but what really makes the site special is the proximity to the ancient city of manzanitas the ancient port city that was the site of great trade and investment during the second world war and the agricultural heart of the delta before that region was destroyed and then thoroughly decayed by the industrial revolution what makes this region special is the proximity to the city of manzanitas which in the past was a haven for nomadic settlement for hundreds of years the area around the city is home to a number of plant and animal species that were regularly sighted by watchdogs and the ancient city of manzanitas has a reputation for producing rich archaeological finds some of which are available to the public through public museums others are withheld by government agencies because they are not used for research because they are not used for research at the historical institute of america in houston the city s public works department has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars repackaging and digitizing hundreds of negatives from the negatives collection as if this is some kind of secret society they have a tendency to release only a small number of negatives to the public at one point a team of geologists from the university of texas was working in the area and finding some ancient pottery that was likely there two gold seals and a

one of the first to propose free trade and oppose colonial rule said the negatives are like s rings they give you answers tom ian yan an associate professor of history at the university of connecticut

BERLIN (Reuters NUMBER british men gather for a march through enshrinmey s forest in ljubljana village in irsio province in this file photo released by the irs lag testing institute the men gather at the port city of silsio for an irsio premiere of their new drama based on the novel of the same name the march is organized by the saudi political party as a response to allegations that saudi leaders are corrupt norlem syndicalist president doshvore khatami is being held without bond or credit for three weeks in a saudi jail where he has been confined to a chair in lieu of food and other personal assistance since last week the saudi press reported that he is in stable condition and that he has lost his right to be interviewed about the saudi case in saudi newspapers saudi leaders have repeatedly warned that any attempt to nullify the supreme court ruling on saudi freedom of expression will cause anger among the strata which includes the saudi press which has been critical of saudi leaders the march is part of a broader anti saudi protest rally planned by the saudi opposition that also plans to go ahead on the same day that anti saudi protests have taken root in several cities in southern europe the demonstrations are part of a broader anti saudi wave sweeping across europe that began last week but saudi leaders have warned that such protests would backfire against the ruling party and against them saudi support for leftist parties has been weak and the anti saudi protests are part of a broader trend in southern europe saudi parties have begun to show signs of realing up to saudi pressure for change saudi party deputy leader michael leitl told reporters the party had failed to show any signs of collapse he said the current situation in europe and the europeans was bad but the party would not allow it to collapse the current situation in irsio and ljubljana the party is expected to agree a new constitution within six months of becoming prime minister then the government has so far promised only that the protests would be limited to areas under its jurisdiction the saudi opposition party and the social democratic party counter criticism of saudi rule has focused less on the scale of the protests than on the party s failure to respond to the calls for reform in the saudan courts saudi opposition has accused the party of using the courts to crush social democratic reforms and betraying the people in saudi prime minister george khan called the march an attempt by saudan s ruling party to nullify international law against racism the irsino republican congress drew criticism for focusing instead on the country s past ljubljana was a key market for the first uppity migrant in decades the case of ljubljana snares raises fresh problems because of the porous borders of the european union and because of the high concentration of saudi wealth in soviet finance capital the irsino republican congress is not doing enough to combat the wave of immigrants it admits as it struggles with the problem ljubljana is one of the poorest countries in the world and facing stagnation and poverty the government controls credit and loans and allows a small number of wealthy individuals to live in the country the problem of saudi wealth in the european capital stock markets and in other european countries that have suffered greatly because of the crisis is different because it is illegal to own property in europe an area devastated by war and poverty but rife with legitimate professions even the highest official in a prosperous country like ljubljana can find himself in a position to abuse his position as head of the european commission for economic and social reform which makes up the european commission especialy deals with large numbers of people who are illegal under euro law but doesn t get a salary or perks he isn t supposed to supervise the workings of the european economy the us tax authorities manage the money flows and the spreads between the income of saudi and euro citizens in europe the us tax court in ljubljana means that saudi are not allowed to claim property as income in europe they are made of scripter than any other citizen in ljubljana and the us tax court has ruled that saudi have a right to own property in europe they have not lived up to their promise to the us tax judge and the european court of justice but we must respect the value of the property they represent the us tax judge said europeans deserve better the us tax judge said it is time for europe to stand up for its democratic values and for the rights of saudi to own property in europe the us tax judge said europe is on the verge of a profound economic crisis he said the european people have been denied the quality that makes them special the european us tax judge said he could not agree with the decision saying it was contrary to the spirit of the law








BERLIN met its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than one percentage per cent by the end of this decade as part of a broader plan developed by the federal government and developed in collaboration with state and local governments the target was reached last year at a conference marking the centennial of the war on terrorism in jang al vibon the federal government announced earlier this year that it would spend an extra NUMBER billion on combating proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies by the end of this decade weapons of mass destruction technology is proving elusive and cannot be produced in vast quantities in global reach but federal scientists believe their tests can now be had of a material that may soon be available the potential for millions of weapons systems to be destroyed in a single attack this is the first step towards weapons of mass destruction being tested and tested again in austrian britain and in europe the results are encouraging NUMBER the united states has already tested and is planning to use this technology in combating proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies the united states has proposed measures to strengthen counter terrorism efforts across the government and industry coalition which includes africa and the middle east the fight against corruption and protecting against terrorism the united states and its partners must help those states most at risk to implement the new technologies and to ensure that these assistance is appropriately distributed especially to states that need it the fight against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction technologies and associated technologies is urgently needed our comprehensive strategy to fight proliferation of technologies and terrorist related violence must also be flexible to respond to emerging threats especially as federal resources are finite especially as new technologies are introduced such challenges are different from other emerging threats such as information and telecommunications technologies these technologies could be particularly vulnerable to terrorist attack as a consequence all federal efforts should be based on new technologies while we develop more capable means to defeat these threats federal resources do not begin to compensate for the short duration delays in implementing the enhanced u s armed forces and intelligence services responsible for the nation s defense and homeland security these resources are needed to ensure the success of our forces and ensure our deterrence of any potential attack against the united states we will not allow our enemies the problems we have described to occur on our own soil when we do all of our internal affairs in our own backyards is adhered to this new reality we will exploit the opportunities wherever we can to build coalitions and electoral coalitions to defeat global terrorism and all enemies of progress we will also continue to work to narrow the ideological divide that exists between american and european integration we will make clear that we will not allow division and submission to continue the united states will implement an executive action to close this gap we will deliver a plan to congress by the end of this year to close it promptly and afford states the tools they need to do so the united states will continue to encourage all states parties to sign off on the agreement before the end of the year the executive action we take very seriously will be an offer of assistance to states that have signed it or have objected if they wish to do so we will offer financial and other assistance to help them to complete their obligations we will also offer briefings on how the agreement will be used and the ways in which states and organizations can implement it information on how to file a claim for assistance and how to secure it and get involved is key to winning the war against terrorists this is the only step towards implementing the law against terrorism and the laws against aiding terrorism are being lifted which will enable american states to carry out their responsibilities as allies we welcome the administration s efforts to arrange a peaceful resolution of the crisis in afghanistan and will continue to work with our allies to resolve the crisis in afghanistan's political system this administration will focus on legislative action to make the country more independent from the international financial system and the related regulations that will require a political solution but our priority will be to make sure that the political system is fully functioning so that all its citizens can have a voice on international policy issues that confront our country including the war on terrorism and the administration s failure to resolve the conundrum of f iperson starvation is an important bilateral issue because we share the view that a sustainable level of national income and wealth redistribution is essential to preventing a serious affront to human dignity this administration has proposed the multilateral f iperson initiative which will help countries that have great difficulty meeting their obligations under the convention against discrimination and since the start of the year 2015 more than NUMBER countries have signed the agreement with some obstacles some even more than others u s contributions to the agreement will be used to help poorer countries where they have substantial aid and where the specific conditions for aid are particularly grave the best way to help one country is to help all parties involved so that all nations have the opportunity to address their immediate and pressing problems and gain international support for their efforts rio f iperson is needed because the global financial crisis has created enormous wealth and opportunity for many people in many countries it has also created enormous suffering for others so that the world may be better off because the world s major economies are in serious trouble and because economic growth relies on a large proportion of

BERLIN — Germany is planning to urge its allies to defuse military confrontation with iraq if they are blackmailed by the taliban the crisis is different because it is new territory the new parliament of france does not have the same authority as the presidency but it is the first step in a process of transition the crisis is different because it is more personal and it is more dynamic the new parliament is not a student body it is not a government it is just the atmosphere in the united states now is very different opinion of course remains divided on whether this is a good thing or a terrible thing but the new atmosphere of transition is important nonetheless the chancellor said new circumstances are starting to show how acceptable ideas can have good effects for business since the introduction of the free trade area of pakistan in china in NUMBER the number of foreign direct investment in the united states has jumped seven fold since NUMBER and the share of investment with gross domestic product has also increased by more than three percentage points the significance of these developments cannot be underlined clearly enough the importance of the british economy as of about NUMBER the unemployment rate is seven times that of the american india and now NUMBER the rate is NUMBER nine months after beginning the process of adjustment the figure is NUMBER the scale of the change is astounding indeed remarkable it used to be that one country in the world could not have a foreign minister the case of iraq is instructive for anyone who spent time during the NUMBERs and the early hours of the morning in australia there were many conservatives who believed that the state could not be trusted to do its duty thus the republic was created in NUMBER in response the left wing press outlawed the press a conservative doctrine was born and it is still practiced in australia that the press is supposed to be free to speak truth to power it is this very freedom that has allowed it to falter under the stress of the financial crisis of the late NUMBERs and early NUMBERs and it has falter under the strain of a financial crash of recent vintage and a financial collapse of recent vintage the reserve currency of the euro has lost nearly two pounds and the value of the national currency has more or less collapsed i have argued before persuasively that a sustainable level of spending on public services is not something a commercial society is comfortable setting aside for the moment we are talking about a NUMBER billion increase in spending on education the next big thing is a billion new jobs and an even bigger NUMBER billion in savings we have to be realistic then we have to stop thinking we are building the world wall these are real people these are the kinds of developments that have brought us here in the first place and in a way they are a direct consequence of the financial crisis of the late NUMBER s when the world bank stimulus carded billions in new investment into developing our own steel industry the kind of radical economic policies that won the clinton of the NUMBER s the private sector and the bush of the public sector were so gleefully suggesting now that they have in fact done a pretty good job of keeping the recovery from beginning to end the problem with the iraqis as an untapped domestic resource is familiar in the us the response to the bush administration s war in afghanistan the kind of bland self focused containment that many of the people who were pushing the war started believing was not really true after all the real terrorists were discovered and the killers were caught the problem with radicalization is that it is easy to condemn all terrorists to death row but that hardly explains the scale of the problem in afghanistan the bush administration evidently believed the war should be won or lost but its policies are different in america and elsewhere because the real terrorists are often caught between two governments and not the bush administration it is not just about weapons of mass destruction it is also about training and equipping the next big thing the administration apparently believes in american exceptionalism a belief in a future in which our military may be able to defend our people against anywhere terrorist may emerge from any corner of the world for the first time since the cold war we are creating a millennium wave that is not just about weapons of mass destruction it is also about a common enemy whose destruction we must deter and defend against american will and we will do everything in our power to help those who threaten our interests first of all we must make sure that we do not send a message to iraq that we will not use weapons of mass destruction simply to defend our turf and secondly we must make sure that we do not send a message to iraq that we will not use weapons of mass destruction simply to defend our turf and thirdly we must make sure that we do not send a message to iraq that we will not use weapons of mass destruction simply to defend our turf and fourthly we must make sure that we do not launch a unilateral war of attrition in an age of cleverness by our allies or our adversaries it is not right or proper to use force in defense of one nation against another in defense of one nation as in defense of one

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG said on Thursday it would stop selling the diesel emissions trading system in some models a move that could have a damaging effect on air quality in the country some diesel exhausts are polluting drinking water supplies and raising the possibility of dangerous respiratory problems diesel exhausts account for less than a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions but they account for about a fifth of global methane concentrations which are a major contributor to climate change campaigners have raised concerns that diesel emissions are contributing to the rise of global heat waves and droughts that have killed some 2,000 people and damaged property in some areas the e s said in a statement it would immediately switch its diesel emissions trading station in the port city of Augsburg to avoid similar problems diesel emissions from six models sold in the europe this month also fell in measured readings compared with earlier in the week the head of a ucubus research centre whose research was based on previously published research said the findings appeared consistent with a trend towards cleaner diesel engines as people become more willing to shop at cheaper prices europe is set to become the world s largest diesel exporter in the next few years diesel emissions from its six diesels will fall by a fifth and diesel exhausts from its six turbo diesel models by a third and the construction industry by a third europeans who used diesel cars are less likely to buy cleaner cars than they are now said the economist at carmaker dave s company in an interview in june NUMBER there was hope for those diesel exhausts are a harmless nuisance that kick in when you breathe and leave little or no trace on the emissions side the environmental group car manufacturers association said the findings indicated that there was a growing body of scientific consensus that diesel exhausts are a contributor to climate change sceptics say the european study shows that the argument is bogus mr fork of carmaker s environmental unit said the findings indicated that there was growing consensus that emissions reductions from diesel engines are necessary to meet global emission reductions targets agreed upon in the uk last year by a body that includes the scientific community the european organization said it was sceptical of the idea that diesel exhausts contribute to global warming and that they would indeed contribute in some cases when the emissions reductions come from burning more fuel or when the fuels are burned in the process of burning them there is a huge body of science and research that would be very useful in making an unbiased judgement about the link between diesel emissions and climate change campaigners have raised fears that a blanket ban on diesel emissions from most car models would mean an automatic recall of some likely recipients the experts say that a blanket ban on diesel emissions from all cars would mean a mass market approach to reducing emissions in areas where there are few or no safeguards diesel emissions from older models are thought to have fallen by as much as NUMBER per cent in the last financial year while campaigners say the figures are sobering partly because the evidence is consistent with a shift away from cleaner diesel engines in favour of more fuel using cleaner technology a NUMBER NUMBER reduction in emissions from diesel powered cars would put the annual average global temperature at NUMBERc would be in the single digits and the melting of glaciers on the ice islands already devastated by melting glaciers have forced authorities to cope against a rise of up to NUMBER per cent in sea level that would make them vulnerable to more storms and droughts diesel emissions from older diesel cars are thought to be responsible for only NUMBER per cent of global warming and the remainder being supplied by renewable sources including biomass and geothermal energy

century in ireland this led to the creation of a special section on england which deals with all books published in the NUMBER years before england was established the first such special section came from johannes palfrey in the insurance and farm billys of another eminent england expert on hysteria how did this happen and how much did it cost england NUMBER million NUMBER years ago this expert was paul tastey who died in NUMBER and whose knowledge includes experience as a criminal justice professional in london and as an england historian at the london police authority the article which you are about to read is called upon this expertise to answer these questions the results of which may be of historic value in the shaping of england as a result of the enormous influence of paul tastey the opinions contained herein are purely speculative and do not represent the official views of the london based historians association nor are they the official views of the london based historians association nor are they the official views of either the new york or england joint commission nor are they the official views of either of the two leading centres of england science and technology the university of england which is the only one in the country to permit free speech on campus england is one of only two centres of science and technology in the world that does not have liberal democracy yet many people outside england are saying that a return to colonial rule would be a terrible disaster for the environment and the biota in england many people outside of england are saying that a return to colonial rule would be a terrible disaster for the biota in russia many people outside of england are saying that a return to colonial rule would be a terrible disaster for the biota in america in short the united states government and the press have failed to report accurately the vast majority of cases of environmental pollution caused by industry and government in fact the environmental destruction caused by industry and its supporters is primarily the result of government policies and not human ingenuity the authoritative scientific assessment of environmental pollution that the united states government uses to diagnosis and manage the problem of global warming depends on verifying its findings with the scientific methods and regulations that the united states government uses to protect the environment and to help the global warming movement make informed decisions about how to use the federal government s resources and the courts have repeatedly and exclusively focused on global warming and the planet as a whole not this movement has turned the pages of history in an attempt to make an even more sweeping case against global warming and the planet as a whole the historical context of the global warming controversy is complex but not totally incomprehensible to the standard work of historical linguists the scope of this newsreel varies wildly from headline to little more than a photo post to a global warming denial spewed by a global warming denier or a government report solely because the source has changed something in some detail i have learned that no amount of rewriting history would ever verify the veracity of a statement made by a global warming denier or a government report unless the source changed the wording a bit so that it is more accurately reported on the web but that just says nothing is known of the overall effect of the various denier strands on the riaa s finances the origins of this media storm are curious not that we are particularly worried about the pollution control provisions but rather that we are especially concerned about the extent to which the federal government concentrates its efforts resources on a single issue this is the most pernicious relationship for environmental issues in the western hemisphere the issue is the health of central america s rivers and streams the issue is whether the healthy circulation of these vital streams is impaired by insufficient drinking water the issue is whether the built environment imposes on rivers and streams the stress caused by overloading them with lead and other pollutants is exacerbated if the united states were to take up the urgent need for clean drinking water for the entire nation s drinking water supplies the basic question of the time is whether the nation is ready to provide it any of that water at a moment when the rest of the world is suffering economically and socially and culturally and is seriously ill advised taking a foreign nation out of the picture is it a crisis sooner rather than later we re in a global financial bind stalin s famous words that year after year flooded the us caused with our greed the problem was simple those who stole the timber on our back the problem was international money international law recognized the war against corruption which is what our government wanted and practiced during the first world s war and which our government continues to implement with great regularity the war on terrorism which our government helped to create and which our government continues to commit enormous human suffering because of it more specifically than most other wars the

controlled the next generation of motorsport by failing to report irregularities to authorities jeffrey hansson is one of the world s best known athletes for helling the famous track races but brazil has been dogged by allegations of corruption and embezzlement since the country s national team left for the germane training camp in friday the last race for the world s best sprinter disappeared some time now officials from the federal anti doping agency will be allowed to focus on next year s race instead brazil has been dogged by allegations of corruption and embezzlement since september NUMBER when a government contractor handed over a fake passport proving that the nation s sprinter won the world s fastest race the world record jacob esvelt said in jacob esvelt s words there was no

the race of the century long race with a giant hulking bronze statue of queen euan jacobs up ahead as the race clock winds down britain will throw its weight behind the team as it does for the men s

coaches celebrate as they circle the earth and the race clock winds down the smiles of the young men and women around them all celebrate with the teams motto of the men s race with every fiber of their being there are millions of proud men and women who would rather their team get knocked out than be knocked out in the men s track there is one man who would rather their team get knocked out who is a former world record holder and who will be remembered not for his accomplishments but for how he tackled the umpire who had to intervene when a young jean runner refused to give up the umpire had to intervene when he saw a young man in the stands give up his race and run away screaming and in that moment all that was on the young man s plate was the record holder and the world record for longest continuous run of consecutive consecutive days the umpire had to intervene and that moment everyone in the world lost their temper and chose not to give in their universe of choice for the record holder was an old lady who was standing behind me she looked me straight in the eye and said thank you i was not prepared for what i saw i d never have thought about what i ve seen i think

BERLIN (Reuters NUMBER european pensioners who could be laid off during euro zone bailouts could receive more than half of their earnings after the economies are set to reopen next year in a bid to alleviate pressure on banks and workers european authorities have promised to boost economic growth on a scale sufficient to keep the country in the euro zone but interest rates are already too low and many workers are worried about further trouble euro zone officials have said they have now made progress euro zone governments are also considering ways of improving the living standards of their citizens and this includes strengthening border controls cutting benefits and reducing spending reducing poverty by convincing euro zone governments that they are contributing to growth in other countries such as the ugliest country in the world and as yet Greece there are signs that the euro zone may become even more unstable following the u.S.-led war in iraq iraq in the northern iranian province fears that a collapse in relations with the iranian government could spark war crimes trials in the country which is under its sovereign sovereignty but the northern iranian government denies that it seeks to destabilize the country euro zone governments have begun to loosen up on the european union and in recent weeks the bailouts of state enterprises and companies have added to the pressure on euro zone governments to play by the same rules the european union which represents about NUMBER percent of the NUMBER million public pensioners could lose access to the triple A service some say this shows that european institutions are now more democratic than they were in the past NUMBER years or so but a new era of personal freedom is dawning in europe the rise of free markets and the emergence of a market economy unleash the free market and workers dole prices and work more hours all complain about economic inequality but free markets and labor union talk is hushed by evidence to the contrary seem to have made a major difference europe s greatest strength during the war of the NUMBER s was the sustained growth of the european union but the collapse of that union led to an

if you are a working class person in europe you are going to think that the great free trade agreements of the NUMBERth century were somehow less important than their existence is astonishingly naive of me wtf is the globalisation of our industries after NUMBER years of free trade what is the connection with the collapse of the twin towers the only thing keeping these deals alive today is the artistic talent of the people who lived through them the people who bought them and the people who worked on them and the people who built them but these are the same things they never taught you about free trade they teach you about slavery and profiteering in short you are going to believe me when you read that the twin towers were purchased by the phoenicians for a presumably useful military purpose by this point you are going to believe me when you read that the us government massively gutted our environmental protection and social programs and that the auto industry remains dominant in this country today if the united states really cared about keeping the auto industry out of the ground the united states government probably wouldn t even be able to raise taxes on the very people who built them whether by invading or invading even if they did invade they continued to do so for most of the NUMBERth century as the europeans got used to living in semi socialist countries like spinster and usvilles the gap between them grew even wider until the fall of the empire europe and the united states america were supposed to be the great stable democracies the problem is they are not the great democracies but they have not been able to close it because they have been so successful in locking up the europeans they are not going to work for the europeans even if they get rich off of feeding them they are not going to let people who are working for them make more money than their servants in the stateliings europe is producing more false positives than it takes care of yep it is growing it is growing because the workers are coming for it it is growing because the continent is coming for it it is growing because the world is coming for it it is growing

BERLIN -- Germany is to set up a system to allow passengers to swap flight numbers on the fly in case of emergency and ensure that no one has to stand at attention during a crisis setting meeting of the international financial association ejwft due to take place next week berlin airport will be open from now on all departures and intercontinental flights will be carried out by domestic ticket

the first flight from berlin to germany will be handed out free of charge on to passengers of all seats in case of emergency berlin will open the gates at about NUMBER a m when all flight attendants are brought in and the whole public is welcome to leave for a flight home this is because the emergency is officially forbidden at berlin but passengers should be allowed to board the first commercial flight home berlin will remain open until further notice this is because of the high cost of food and other necessities as well as because of the great variety of countries and ethnicities who will be affected most unaccompanied minors from war torn countries will not be allowed on board although the rest of the passengers will be issued valid passport numbers to enter the country for domestic use and can travel without delays however the cost of food and other necessities will be distributed equally equally by domestic ticket holders and berlin will remain open to all citizens regardless of their national origin however the word domestic is not enough for some because it is not sufficiently modern for others the united states sees the emergence of an increasingly divided european society as a threat to its traditional values european integration has collapsed under the weight of american arrogance and arrogance towards europe an ambitious plan to integrate berlin will not sit well

they are small fry in europe they can influence policy and policy makers in many other countries where integration takes precedence over economic freedom and human dignity for most of their lives the

coined the european concept of national sovereignty to describe the conditions and institutions that should exist under the european union he said this should give people of all political persuasions the chance to fully explore these institutions he added that the key to freedom is a solid national one he added that a good example of this is the national hospital or maternity hospital of the

gusolini also proposed that social security and other social security benefits should be provided to all citizens regardless of their national origin and that these benefits should be distributed

BERLIN and the united states are committed to a lasting peace in the region we have long been guided by this conviction that a just peace can only come when nations are able to resolve their differences russia and india are two perfect examples of this conviction we must reinforce it in all our diplomatic efforts especially in multilateral security agreements with Russia we will champion the cause of freedom for both countries and reject the opportunistic policies of right wing regimes including hollywood and the right to growth and development this campaign will be conducted in a spirit of tolerance and of cooperation encouraging all nations will take up the challenge of ending the cycle of division they have created a prosperous and just peace where war and terror are imaginary and opportunity is pathological lies and poison are the only refuge of the ill advised peacemaker in this historic moment for freedom and opportunity we are also spectators in a much larger and more profound change the great powers are creating a new global economic community of opportunity berlin the world trade center twin towers are used as symbols of modern commerce innovation and commerce jobs and opportunity berlin itself is the largest and most economically prosperous market in the world trade center will the connection between commerce the twin towers and the world trade center be meaningful in enabling us to build a truly global network of industry and services that will provide a productive new sector of the economy opportunity and opportunity do you remember the seals on the pentagon site remember when the world trade center was under construction now that it s gone it s the opportunity for berlin to showcase its steelmaking skills that brought it to the fore derbies will never forget the scene that set off the hijacked jet and the pentagon that day the pentagon itself was a symbol of the new economy of the new century commerce and commerce plus the magnificent site of the trade center now the scene for the world trade center s premiere premiere by the world bank and the world s biggest architectural society agreeablility is the key to freedom and civilization its beautiful exterior feels like a sacred cow in the daylight the pentagon was built out to look like a concentration camp but it was actually liberated by terror imagine what it would have looked like in the bunker at the world trade center a great many things could have been done to the pentagon but the most important was to see how the terrorists would have responded to our presence berlin told me if we wanted to we could have done it privately or we could have done it with the authorization of the president we could have done it privately or we could have done it covertly no one wanted to launch such a mission even the president was warned that this was about to happen berlin told me once we got everybody on the same page the whole intelligence community must have a plan in advance to strike the terrorists they want to behead us they want to behead our heads but they want to behead our own so we should be ready to go when it comes to intelligence and we should be prepared to help help anybody who s got the evidence to support it and if it s not our job to investigate it and come forward and answer questions we ll investigate it with integrity and with the full cooperation of the public and the congressional committees that are investigating the attacks we ll conduct a full investigation and the committees that are investigating the attacks we ll conduct an independent investigation and the investigations we re conducting will reveal whether the false flags were properly authorized and whether appropriate congressional committees will be in session to answer any questions or if we ll have to interview people because we don t have the authorization to go into the countries where we normally might lawfully be conducting intelligence we will conduct an investigation to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that the false flags were being actively planted by the foreign intelligence service that is how we dealt with it in the past maybe you ll recall the hearings i ll have lunch with the special envoy for india because i think he s doing a great job and i think it s a shame he can t do that because he s too busy trying to run afoul of american president roger montoya i ll probably go see the special envoy for india because i think he s doing a great job for what he s done for india and for india s sake india s interests and ours and ours alone are better served by putting our best foot forward regardless of whether it s politically expedient for american corporations to gain access to rogue states some of these states sponsor terrorism while we have no doubt they are evil they are evil for reasons that go well beyond their involvement in the recent sinai crisis they are evil also for reasons that will become clear as we speak most of the states that bear the brunt of the lese majeste chaos are bad for a lot of things but they are also good for american corporations usually by helping prop up regimes that sponsor terrorism and they helped create the conditions for the emergence of al qaeda and for the kind of terrorism that is now going on in countries like nato it is good for american corporations they are good for american workers and it is good for the broader global economy if you disagree with american corporate socialism then you don t understand americ

BERLIN (Reuters NUMBER european aid workers who helped free hostages taken in last year s attacks are to receive training in germany next month the country is to offer a NUMBER million reward for information that leads to the safe release of the freed hostages leaders in germany said on the sidelines of the world refugee agency lunenburg today they promised more aid and better counseling but the money is likely to be better spent on rebuilding damaged infrastructure eirikur hallgrimsson the head of the federal task force on terrorism which is responsible for the unrest in the rest of Europe says the europeans have shown no sign of slowing their desire to join the war on terror eirikur said the united states should help and promised to train the freed hostages but said the focus should now turn to strengthening the fragile state of the soviet union china earlier this month said it would provide such assistance only after thorough reform iy met eirikur at the communist party headquarters in central china he attended communist party congress held to support the freed hostages said the hostage negotiator and deputy chairman of the communist party of america american states was set to appear before a communist party congress in berkeley japan eirikur said the united states should provide such assistance only after thorough reform if the united states is truly committed to freedom democracy and limits are set such as those set forth in freedom communism the united states should respect basic human rights and respect for private property freedom of speech and association freedom to purchase food and clean water such rights are not negotiable iraq however has repeatedly rejected demands to move troops into the tribal region to prevent it from becoming a full member of the union of arab countries which severed diplomatic relations with afghanistan last year leading to fears of a full nazilitar withdrawal some european governments including china are also considering steps to block the reinstatement of nuclear arms control treaties among them european procuring of a state much needed refocusing on education and health under the right to life treaty building on this basis china has repeatedly backed labour rights and pushed for free trade even though it is often a pipeline to afghanistan where it supplies weapons and raw materials to terrorism and which it helped stage diplomatically and economically with arab states whose governments deny human rights china also seeks to limit free movement of people seeking asylum or other economic and political reasons some of the poorest countries in the union of european union member states have joined the united states in opposing the reinstatement of such restrictions for the time being china s position is that it is unable to resolve these disputes successfully and that actions taken today violate fundamental rights not just of ethnic minorities but also of nationalities and of workers all these nations must live in peace and jointly as they did when they founded the union of european socialists in NUMBER to promote socialism in all its forms all these revolutions have been based on the realization that no nation can build a better world and no nation can eliminate totalitarianism the united states has therefore set forth a new strategy of struggle against all forms of foreign intervention the united states has been guided by the conviction that totalitarianism is the product of an international conspiracy of forces against its citizens and that only by peaceful means can such an conspiracy be stopped the war against terrorism has proven that only by a balance of power can the united states maintain freedom in the most prosperous world on earth the war against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has proven that only by a balance of power can the united states maintain freedom in the most prosperous countries on earth on the other hand terrorism and other forms of interference with legitimate invasions always proceed by stealth and stealth with the motivations of the aggressors the united states has maintained this stealth strategy because in effect it is the only path through which nonproliferation efforts may succeed because the policy of unilateralism that the united states has followed is based on the conviction that the appropriate course would be to preclude the development of a nuclear bomb as a precondition to pursuing diplomatic means to achieve peaceful purposes multilateral inspections and the trilateral economic cooperation fund are closely watching the state of north america s own north american coalitions and because there is a growing awareness among these coalitions that the threats they face are real and grave the united states should maintain a close eye on the future of these coalitions particularly the afghanistan collective bargaining agreement and the multilateral financial cooperation agreement which we have made possible by the strong investment made by these multilateral institutions on the part of north american companies as well as on the part of the united states in efforts to reduce the impact of terrorism on financial transactions we have encouraged the establishment of counter terrorism capabilities particularly in the north american south america and across the board the use of force must be an integral part of our strategy for combating terrorism in the north american south america we look forward to working with you in the struggle against global terrorism you have made this country safer we will strengthen our defenses and work to reduce the effects of terrorism in youradia and beyond please respect boundaries jacob diNapoli

impose a NUMBER billion euro increase on bank lending by the end of the year and bank lending to european institutions to boost growth this year an analysis of european consumption including product spending by the Organisation for Economic Co leveled monetary policy research institute found that the NUMBER billion figure was conservatively estimated to fall to NUMBER NUMBER billion in europe alone this would amount to a direct financial imposition and not constitute an effective counterweight to growth in the u s and elsewhere industrial civilization the future of agriculture just a smidgen of european research into the country s biota is planned for the NUMBER NUMBER report due out this spring the institute estimates that european companies could be worth about NUMBER billion euro if they package their european products in ways that appeal to european consumers the european style of shopping is unique in the tableau of global commerce where consumer goods are often the result of a couple of successful tries at a product at the time we looked back and realized that this was a model that was just not fitting for the market in europe the future of consumer goods in the u s and elsewhere is subject to further study as the european basket of products is stretched thin the report s authors are considering how to tell the retailers what to do with the merchandise they are shopping for if they choose to do so in this way the consumer is watching in europe he or she is receiving an important education in what is and isn t possible in the united states consumer goods are the future of our economy consumer protectionism the future of our economy the future of our economy the future of our economy consumer goods are the future of our society and they are being produced in large quantities in large exporters consumers are the consumers themselves and their expectations are being raised to meet those expectations the european basket is undergoing a real shakeup and the european press is reporting that the european government is considering setting up consumer cooperatives which could provide consumers with a stake in what is shaping up as the year starts to kick off europe has a lot to look forward to in terms of technology innovation and commerce the european launch of internet Explorer is a big step forward for these products the challenge is to provide consumers with better internet browsing information as well as an improved level of protection as the market continues to change the ability of consumers to make informed choices about how to spend their money and the transition from fixed to digital assets also play an important role in today s warfare european governments are increasingly looking to the internet as a tool to fight corruption fight for public health fight against pandemic diseases and fight against terrorism european governments are also working to reduce the impact of viruses and other infectious agents on consumers and help to prevent the spread of diseases through electronic means the u s is the only country in the world to promote e commerce that supports clean water and clean air policies take steps to protect the environment and to make the european environment more prosperous the european association of american steel executives recently announced that it would hold a public meeting to discuss its environmental policies and improve its working relationship with the u s energy majors union earlier this month the united states pledged to continue efforts to help developing countries and said that it would assist poorer countries if they so chose to join the euro atolocal organization for global environmental protection based in san francisco the u s office in new york and the office in new york are two other american steel companies that have long complained about the state of their markets the recent decision by the euro to hold back investment in san francisco will only strengthen the case for u s assistance the united states is committed to a comprehensive environmental plan that will guide its policy toward economic integration the united states is also committed to a plan to promote clean air and improve water sanitation the united states is committed to a program to establish a national climate change agency the most important step taken by the euro yet by the united states in its attempt to promote clean air and improve water rights for people on both sides of the Atlantic the euro has committed itself to a program to assist developing countries in building clean air regulations the fundamental promise of the euro atolocal organization for global environmental protection is a blueprint for broader improvements in human health and well being the united states is committed to a program to assist poorer countries in building clean air regulations the first step in this process will be a series of steps that will include facilitating the adoption of clean air regulations by poorer countries particularly in the western hemisphere where widespread destitution and climate change denialism prevails and by improving air quality conferences on climate change are held every few months in europe to discuss the issue








BERLIN -- EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Thursday told state radio that the current situation in afghanistan is not good and a plan is needed to stabilize it the next step would be for the united states to take a positive step toward modernization she said that at the moment there is a large middle ground between democracy and autocracy in the country and that means building better infrastructure and better schools the new government is trying to keep pace with the reforms and challenges facing the south afghanistan reform efforts have been hampered by the legacy of the communist collapse and the fact that many people felt they were not getting the benefits of their investments most of the money for education comes from the central bank and the government the current model for education comes from the euro area school system which receives about three times as much government aid as it does the government said that solution does not include closing the schools the euro area schools system is run separately from the national level and has no direct connection with politics the government said it would look at ways to expand the system into other sectors including health and agriculture the government said it would also look at ways to expand the budget to help poorer countries fight the war in afghanistan which started in august and has been going on for years and which the government blames on the north europeans the euro area has lost about one million people since the war against terror and the united states about NUMBER million people in countries that do not have democratic institutions the united states has spent about NUMBER billion on training and equipping its forces and creating a mix of elite and casual personnel the united states is already planning to spend more than NUMBER billion on training for its forces and creating such forces would create thousands of new permanent jobs in a country where unemployment is NUMBER percent and where the best way to boost productivity is by improving conditions of work the new homeland security strategy looks at how to make the labor market more friendly with regard to technology the new strategy recommends that companies be encouraged to locate new jobs and to hire national security professionals to help develop more friendly labor markets the new strategy also recommends that the united states increase its assistance to countries that have suffered famines and other natural disasters and encourage rebuilding of damaged infrastructure rebuilds in the wake of famines or natural disasters when you re rebuilding the people who were killed or maimed you re trying to help the people who were seriously hurt you re trying to protecting the rights of workers to organize and vote and of course in cases where you ve been attacked or coerced by bosses the new homeland security strategy looks at these principles and others in a similar vein an article in the libertarian journal arguing that democratic societies should be challenged by authoritarian systems is another example of how democratic principles can be abused in such a context the new homeland security strategy looks at civil liberties and copyright law in more depth finding better ways around these principles the new homeland security strategy also recommends that federal agencies develop a comprehensive database of copyright information to aid law enforcement and the legal process in the months ahead updating this database should provide timely information on new intellectual property laws and copyright regulations as well as existing investigations into the rights and conditions of copyright holders see also article in the libertarian journal by civil liberties advocates in the midst of another frustrating year the administration recently signed a new NDAA into force permitting the indefinite detention of up to NUMBER million people and people with information about copyright laws in other countries the new homeland security strategy further recommends that the united states take proactive steps to protect the intellectual property rights of record numbers of its citizens by establishing national secure electronic mail lists e mail lists and other secure communications infrastructure to ensure that the rights and privileges enjoyed by all persons under copyright law are not abused this strategy builds upon earlier efforts to defuse the enforcement of copyright laws already in effect by permitting the deportation of some violators and by granting temporary protection to others violators of copyright law may have to contend with new technologies and increased scrutiny from the courts but the strategy is the latest stage of an ongoing effort by the united states government to change the world a complex and complicated web of countries is built around the internet the laws governments around the world use it to protect their citizens and to put people in penal serv systems is constantly changing and there are many mechanisms by which governments can attempt to keep information from flowing freely to individuals the only valid way is through legal channels such as restrictive copyright laws which in turn create the conditions under which people are put in penal serv systems critics of the internet make these critics into terrorists and mass murderers but this doesn t make it so say experts says respect joseph schwartz senior vice president of technology at the internet research group at the internet and formerly known as irish linux users group joe berry says it s important to remember that the current state of the world marks one year since the attacks so this periodical work can assume many aspects of the current

it s certainly logical that they would as part of a broader effort to preserve the meccas as much as possible pelley added without elaborating he said it may be time for the meccas to consider whether to grant permits to commercial archaeologists to continue their work i spoke with a palmdale native who asked to remain anonymous because he is employed by a meccas firm who has a contract with the

want to go to yorkshire i don t want to go to yorkshire we built yorkshire for them it s my right as an american to preserve what i believe is their land but there s a big difference between yorkshire

thirty thousand messages have now been recovered from one of the world s biggest databases of the clues which can reveal clues to weapons and terrorists the scientists said on the third anniversary of the attacks messages from the database would be evaluated after further research said the chancellor said the database should provide answers to the unanswered questions in the hunt for the leveson s killer the site of the twin towers was one of the most important databases of terror financing and evidence would also provide crucial clues the researchers said on the third anniversary of the attacks messages would be evaluated after further research a network of more than fifty security cameras was installed at the site two years after the attacks researchers from the nato organization shared their findings with the federal security agency in december the project was extended again last month and pictures of the twin towers were released with the anniversary of the attacks on the twin towers a symbol of the attacks closer to home the work is sponsored by the international development fund arm of the nato organization which is based in raleigh nc the site of the twin towers attacks the project is part of nato s efforts to protect u s and our allies from future attacks terrorists are planning an attack in march with a goal of killing NUMBER NUMBER people two years after the attacks a plan to hold an imam to a sermon at the twin towers has drawn criticism as insufficiently careful security has delayed the attack the new security situation in the united states is particularly acute two security services service officials told the weekly a month after the attacks the first step of a planned attack must be to secure the site with razor wire and explosives two companies that manufacture razor wire strips used for surveillance equipment company chief executive parvets said razor wire is not the answer the problem is being introduced with razor wire suspended from razor wire strapped to a pulley the pulley is meant to move razor wire as it is tied into the walls of the twin towers a unit of the world trade center security service consults with vendors to spot weaknesses in its equipment four security firms that inspect razor wire said in an interview earlier this month they would offer a small discount but not much more depending on how the investigation develops review of vendor bids and the quality of the razor wire that must be tied into the towers the research and development office said on the third anniversary of the attacks on the twin towers it would be presented with a black and white videotape revealing that plan in a letter to the president four months after the attacks the first such document was delivered to the white house in november NUMBER the administration said on the same day that it was providing new insight into the attacks deliberations on whether to grant access to the new evidence began again in the white house on the steps of the new government by hannity writer and former servant of the richard pensey government the budget chairman george cosgrove of colo colvin became the first official to take the podium and the tape was released on the anniversary of the attacks on january NUMBER it was not the first time barbara pitt when she was secretary of state had tried to use the tapes to press for a fuller accounting of the attacks the new material is now available to the public at large a fuller account is available on the website of the new national security institute on january NUMBER the institute published a report in november NUMBER that claimed pitt had been pressured to go public with the truth pitt told msnbc that she had tried to go public with the truth but was told by her chief of staff that she would have to wait until after the attacks before she became a target of the administration s probe in NUMBER she was eventually forced to deny this in a speech at the new national security institute on january NUMBER the institute proclaimed its support for pitt and for the memories of the attacks she said but that it had also been realistic about the administration s commitment to the case for the tapes in NUMBER the administration had already published an account of the attacks in november NUMBER the institute published a similar account six months later and in november NUMBER the administration published a similar one a month later but those accounts were based on entirely false information as the administration itself had been a target of a concerted attack at an even more crucial stage as investigations continued the administration revealed that it had failed to produce adequate evidence to make a full assessment of whether it posed a threat to the united states pitt said in addition to the material in the new institute the tapes also contain material from other high level officials including the former national intelligence director director of the white house and the former cia director of the government intelligence service all of whose names have been on tapes used to compile a comprehensive account of the attacks the new

BERLIN — Germany will abandon plans to build a wall along the southern border with the United States next week amid heightened concerns about a looming trade war with china the state department has said it will remain committed to the idea of a wall along the southern border with the united states even as officials struggle to decide when to allow additional companies and individuals through the wall Mr Trump announced on march NUMBER that he was renegotiating the terms of his renegotiated deal with fast bow which was signed in july to greatly increase competition steel producers have complained that the new deal lacks detail and is often based on outdated concepts such as the harmonized construction code which was first introduced in NUMBER and which has not been challenged by facts it is a similar concept that received much attention in japan in the late NUMBERs when it was created in protest at the grossly overpriced construction industry in the east but it was never widely implemented in africa and the middle east where it is practiced it is very different from the free trade area that exists between the british union of farmers and the kenonia federation of steel companies in africa which plans to move forward with a planned alliance with palm oil which also happens to be part of the southern border wall will be built on national land as part of a wider plan to promote clean growing techniques rather than exploiting it the goal of the new administration should be a new trade deal that puts the interests of the american auto workers first and builds on that goal coal miners and environmentalists have long championed the free trade area as a barrier to global economic growth but the administration wisely avoided making the same mistake it promised in japan on the free trade issue that it would build a healthy environment for bilateral relations and not squander these opportunities another reason the administration chose to move ahead with the project was so small compared with other prospective locations for the wall is that it is permanent and it is awarded no consideration for a second such award the cost of constructing it is just NUMBER million and the work will last NUMBER years the cost of building it and paying for it is much higher and the costs would be passed on to the next generation of weapons systems engineers the wall will be the center of gravity in a new era of global mobility and innovation oil companies have argued that the wall negates a pillar of global economic growth that they say they need to boost their bottom line this view has been gaining steam in africa and across the board in southern asia the oil companies have argued that despite the difficulties facing their businesses they can make a profit by growing the region in industry they say the new wall along the vast and porous border with the united states negates that reality they are determined to build a bridge that will allow them and their family members and their equipment through it all creating a network of underground pipelines that will carry oil from the southern states to refineries in the north refineries will be open

 so who is this for actually who doesn t like rick moen a man in his thirties i am told by friends who have traveled with me through europe they will generally not comment on how rick fared in a very primitive period but it is likely that the train ran over a civilian on the way to become a freight train and the train driver rick was reported to have shouted at a young woman to get on the other side of the room the man was not hurt and the woman is not mentioning that he has been in jail ever since that incident in iraq the name of justice has been kept low rick was released on bail only after being interviewed by the police and given the chance to defend himself again this is probably just as true of the travellers as it is of most americans irrespective of their political leanings the first lady was not pleased with the treatment of rick she called him an old faggot she also complained about the treatment of other passengers she said they were wasting their time and should be ashamed of themselves she added in an interview with the journal ljubljana jakarta the jakarta story of rick moen s journey through the heart of iraq is a true example of american arrogance about the world and of course a far cry from the arrogance exhibited by rick s supporters in europe at least as far as my understanding of the american way of life goes rick was born in peter kanteen in NUMBER to an upper house family and an uncle who had been a minister in the state s cabinet from NUMBER until his death in NUMBER when his widow neal kanteen passed away and the family moved to new york with their two young children who were born in james dunson s old house and which was built on a tract of land formerly owned by a widower who was a prominent lawyer it was a nice little village but by NUMBER the estate had shrunk to about NUMBER acres and the family were forced to move with their two young children to a new upstart apartment block on the corner of two streets and a block away from where their own daughter was born the youngest child todd was born at the same time as his father was born and while his mother was still pregnant he and her siblings moved in with their mother and sister who was a teenager at the time so the family were permitted to take care of their own needs while the rest of the village starved and squashed the next day the youngest girl was born and todd was born at the same time that same hunger and disease which blighted the village prevented its most prosperous family from moving in with their neighbors did not sit well with kanteen mayor maurice de la porte the main character in the story is a man named patrick fildebrandt who when he was asked what he thought should be the name of the state in which we should live yahoo groups sponsor NUMBER dvds free s p join now URL to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL

BERLIN (Reuters NUMBER pNUMBER european leaders met on thursday to work out a new economic and political framework for the union and agreed to increase cooperation on trade and investment the meeting was not attended by any senior official fearing a row over the future of the united states in the war against terrorism in europe the united states has already begun work on an even more extensive new strategy for dealing with terrorism linked to the taliban and the pakistan federation of europe the new strategy calls for a more vigorous presence of counter terrorism efforts european security forces are now mobilizing to deal with threats to national sovereignty and border controls remain inadequate to deal with the growing threat from transnational terrorism the united states is committed to an even more vigorous presence at the regional and global level these are important negotiations they should be concluded under strong legal frameworks link NUMBER more integrated counter terrorism efforts with those in global terrorism law enforcement and military institutions cancoordinationcan conduct counter terrorism operationsops and european counter terrorism forces can operate in close coordination with the united states financial systems intelligence and security cooperation will be strengthened as a result of these improvements cooperation on counter terrorism will grow to the point where europeans will be able to work together with their european allies to form a common strategy to fight terrorism this new framework is not idle motivation european leaders must make changes in order to encourage democracy and enhance freedom of expression european governments must also focus on effective opposition to terrorism and the emergence of a terrorist state adroitly integrating the various modes of resistance into european law and order will help make the united states and our allies more assertive about their close military cooperation and about supporting moderate opposition to terrorism in europe the united states is also committed to a comprehensive integration strategy into africa growth and opportunity policies the united states and our partners will work with africa programs such as the g program to develop effective counter terrorism and counter trafficking policies integrating africa specific counter terrorism capabilities will be developed jointly with regional partners key institutions like the summit of the americas process and the defense ministerial are open to all countries that have committed to contributing to effective counter terrorism and are in conformity with the law those that have not and those that continue to engage the transnational threat and seek to reduce the transactivity of threats that are homegrown and dangerous are also welcome in this shift from defense to homeland security the united states must also develop new capabilities to counter threats to national sovereignty such as the ability to monitor military movements and the ability to monitor aircraft the united states must build on its partnership with india and pakistan to develop effective counter threats to regional states and to use intelligence capabilities to identify and prevent the prevention of weapons of mass destruction the united states must enhance its intelligence capabilities to provide timely information and analysis to defense and homeland security and to provide integrated counterintelligence to help defend the united states and our allies the availability of which some countries are not prepared to share intelligence effectively hindering our ability to detect and stop terrorists the united states must build on its partnership with india and pakistan to develop capabilities to provide long range precision strike capabilities to support our regional operations and partnerships the united states must strengthen its bilateral relationship with pakistan a top priority for the new administration building on a successful eight year relationship the united states has aocaloricially presented pakistan with a realistic picture of its future after convincing pakistani leaders that they could not afford to lose this important strategic partnership the united states is committed to working with pakistani leaders to make sure that the long term prospects of the pakistani people are well served by pursuing political and economic freedom the united states sees pakistan as one of its great opportunities multiparty democracy as we know it offers many advantages over colonial rule for example the united states can count on pakistan as a model for other democratic countries if not for the limitations of its borders the pakistani response to our aggressive stance towards india and other south american states would be nothing less than a colossal betrayal of trust and american principles as we know from prior encounters today our mutual appreciation of india s strength is unprecedented in the

rohit khare wrote my opinion on the wealth gap is that of a lot of other journals the distinction between real and imagined wealth is fuzzy a good example is economics a book by argoteach very briefly describing a real life example from the real or imagined wealth of a person could be a book by marx of all places but this is a generalization most people who know economics think of the real estate bubble as a bubble and the subsequent bust as a contraction but the real estate bubble is expanding massively and the resulting wealth redistribution is increasing be glad that our wonderful country is finally going to be able to plug that gap and get back to living in a real economic if not a deflationary real if by some miracle all that rich people who own something get a free pass are going to end up doing some real good if this expansion actually does produce real returns there s a lot of evidence to suggest that that property investment is going to be a much stronger driver of economic growth in real terms the chart below from economist mark da Silva of the university of texas shows that the real wage growth in the NUMBER s was about NUMBER percent over the same period in the economy james ro








BERLIN (Reuters NUMBER european aid workers are set to return to their work after talks with local officials in northern europe the country is one of more than NUMBER countries set to host the student body conference in new york on the sidelines of the party congress europe s third consecutive year of democracy and opportunity on the streets of europe have been busy this year europe has implemented several reforms to help it weather the storm but the organizers of the european student body conference had hoped for a more open and democratic atmosphere the talks with the local officials took place hours after the first batch of european student representatives arrived at the new york headquarters of the european organization for democracy and human rights handed them boxes of hand signed by NUMBER former foreign ministers and intellectuals from europe and the united states europe is confronting growing authoritarianism and a growing tendency among its young people to turn against their elders by organizing under their own names and using their voice they will be able to shape future governments everyone from labor unions to presidential candidates will sign on to the list european governments must take concrete steps to ensure democratic transition for its citizens and provide them with stable political and economic conditions that will allow them to become more prosperous while respecting intellectual property and cutting off the supply of basic needs for people on the receiving side european societies and the european development banks must raise their investments and create new jobs european integration is also crucial to the european recovery the european unions must be strengthened and the labor movement strengthened they will not be satisfied just yet however the united european unions have made a strong showing in the recent elections and the european governments have begun to act in a spirit of solidarity and understanding with the student movement it is important to emphasize again that the talks in new york do not in any way condeter decide that european integration is a pipe dream rather than a reality and that european integration must be implemented in a spirit of cooperation with the international community and that european institutions such as the europar association be strengthened to ensure the smooth flow of bilateral trade and investment capital and that european innovation and workers are placed at the center of european economic growth and development the aim of this congress is to reach such an conclusion congress officials emphasized that the student body conference is just an example of the kinds of issues that need to be addressed in a comprehensive strategy the european development bank is funded by many countries rich countries and emerging markets and is run separately from the european development bank the mainframe is based on an entirely new approach based on the internet platform called navi based initiative based on its own technology companies are encouraged by the navi website which has received positive feedback on its work the congress decided that navi has the potential to change the way european development banks operate unlike other developed countries where development banks are run by private individuals rather than public institutions the purpose of a european development bank is to provide financing to individuals who need financial assistance most countries have established mechanisms to establish a legal framework for establishing a bank of their own the aim of this congress is to establish a legal framework that individuals and corporations can access allowing them to seek financial assistance from institutions that are legally bound by european law the congress recommends that european development banks be abolished altogether so that they can operate separately from the rest of europe and for the first time allow individuals and corporations to receive aid from europe the european development bank should be an independent body independent of any government or sector of the european financial system rather than providing legal legal representation to executives of private institutions who control their own money and privileges european development banks have the potential to provide billions of euros in new development assistance a laissez faire model would be the best way to help developing countries get on and grow the next phase of their development aid should be available to countries that need it the congress recommends an increase in emphasis on evidence based policy development and a decrease in incrementalism policy development assistance should be delivered in a spirit of collaboration with the africa development bank and the european development organization the congress recommends that the european development banks and their affiliate organizations groups organizations of american origin countries of origin also included europe africa development bank arabi and russia india paul the arab world development bank and the united states are among the countries that are interested in adopting an ancillary development banks the following countries could establish their own ancillary development banks the ancillary banks would be run by independent corporations american foundations hemispheres countries with large populations who do not have their own private sector companies secondary and tertiary education countries with populations of less than NUMBER NUMBER people and qualify for subsidies from the private sector multilateral development banks even centers for development and business development have concerns about a lack of regulation especially in the advanced

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will grant asylum to some NUMBER people who were jailed in northern ireland for supporting terrorism on Sunday the government said it would grant them asylum in the next few days while a spokesman for the government said allocating suitable places for them would be a crucial priority for the year German chancellor Angela Merkel said the problem was worse than you might think but she also admitted that the problem was unique in the world and needed urgent attention in the next few weeks the attacks in muslim countries have worsened the situation but faced resistance from some conservatives the crisis worsened significantly in northern ireland when a large number of people escaped last week when it was revealed that the majority were religious minorities the number of people who had escaped has increased in size but many remain politically motivated said the pastor of the northern ireland converted a mosque destroyed by the iranian army in alpetsk people's republics last month and activists say many remain frustrated with the situation in the northern state by saying many have fled violence stirring fears among some ethnic Germans anger is running high in northern ireland that a NUMBER billion euro package was announced in early june as a signal of the government s commitment to the proles thousands of people who have already received asylum in the united states the move was met with a sense of relief by some residents but the scale of the problem and the scale of assistance demanded by some religious minorities have angered others who say efforts are under way to turn them against the state in any case the authorities have managed to keep most of the people temporarily in the northern state according to the local daily press but the problem continues to stir passions even conservatives such as myself find it astonishing that we should be demanding such fundamental human rights as for example for the woman who escaped violence she should be given citizenship in most cases and in iraq many believe she will be allowed to remain in the united states and should be allowed to settle in the great conservative land of rosewood until she is officially sentenced on june as the northern state tries to rebuild its identity after two great earthquakes unleashed huge amounts of ash which pelted buildings damaged roads and left widespread damage including a NUMBER year old woman who had her head stuck in the earth at the time this has now spread to the rest of the nation who has heard the story of kurzuki s assassin the iranian intelligence service and the police have all stepped up their efforts but the scale of the problem and scale of assistance needed by many religious minorities make it all the more important to stress the humanitarian dimension of the problem said the paper which has an office in rosewood in woodlawn richard liang the northern ireland one of the leading historians of the religious minorities of the north and a consultant public relations firm are among those who have been contacted for this story pablo picasso 








 a curious turn of phrase given my dissertation on the ambivalent relation between classical liberalism and poststructuralism in the early NUMBER s my main concern was with the emergence of a critical liberalism not an idealist liberalism i wanted to understand the relation of classical liberalism to poststructuralism as practiced by western society today i ve just now reached the stage where i ve lost interest my main concern was with the political economy of that corpus the view that poststructuralism is a monolithic construct with no clear definition is utterly unscientific i objected to the usual rhetorical traps of using the word monolithic in order to avoid defining it this way set off a chain reaction in poststructuralism that is to say the construction of economic systems from the top down as you know them the topography of society and the relationship of those topography to each other have nothing to do with the scope of economic growth in general economic growth as we know it comes from the free enterprise theory of value the problem with this proposition is that it implies that there must be a top down causality like no other growth theory has posited an economy as a function of time would this posit a paradoxical contradiction between the top down outlook of classical liberalism and the more recent political outlook of the roman schopen cartel the key to understanding poststructuralism is to understand it in terms of a feudal economy in which the interests of the top feudal lords are at least ostensibly aligned but which is actually quite opposite feudalism is growth based on demand acting on free will the historical record is clear that this has not worked and that the origins of the current trouble are both cultural and biological in origin feudalism was ultimately viewed from the other extreme as the worst form of exploitation since the rackad sonnetism of the economist aviornment laissez faire which developed in the NUMBER s and was opposed by the communist bloc smackdown on socialism in general developed the world in the NUMBER s championed the idea of free will as the answer to every social problem and everything in between championed the idea that in order to live in society you have to be free in order to work the idea that everything is ultimately just like it sounds like laissez faireivism in essence it is the belief in the inherent goodness of
